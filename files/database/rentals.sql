(119031,E'2017 Transit Adventure Van',E'camper-van',E'Say hello to Javi - a Ford Transit 250 high-roof set up as a most-awesome camping/travel experience!  This RV is built with storage in mind - it has a massive ‘gear trunk’ in back for bulk/dirtier items and cabinets and drawers galore in the house area.\n\nThe van is also built for extended off-grid, or even simply un-plugged, adventure capability.  200 watts of roof-mounted solar keep the 300 amp-hours of AGM power storage topped off, with a small fridge, 2 high capacity roof fans, recessed LED lighting, and a 2000 watt pure-sine inverter wired into the house area to provide normal 120 volt home-outlet power along with USB charger ports.\n\nJavi makes the most of van-space, and provides the must-have luxury of a queen sized bed that also folds up and away into a couch & relaxing area when not in use, and a 6-foot, 5-inch ceiling height.  There is also easy-access water storage/drainage under the sink, and there is no complicated drainage-pipes system that has to be dumped properly and no worrying about freezing risks or expensive repairs if damaged.\n\nYou’re set for cooking - you’ve got an easy to use butane single-burner inside, along with an outdoor propane grill if you prefer to cook with the sun on your shoulders.  You have running water via electric up pump for washing hands or filling bottles to take on a hike.\n\nWHAT MAKES THIS UNIQUE (and what I do differently for you to ensure you’ll have the best experience possible…)\n\nIf you’ve been camping, you know how much of a headache it is to finally arrive at your perfect destination only to realize you’ve forgotten to pack something important...I know, because I’ve found myself in that situation before, and little things like “we forgot the sunscreen, propane, and bug spray!” can really put a dent in your fun.  Heck, even forgetting ketchup or salt/pepper can be a bummer.  I have done my absolute best to ensure that every crucial convenience, cooking, recreational, and safety item will be there, stored & ready if you need it - always.  If you forgot it, you need it, or you just noticed something useful in the included gear - feel free to help yourself to the pre-packed & at-the-ready kits, stored and labeled for you.  No extra charges.\n\nToiletries and Convenience: sunscreen, bug spray, charger cables, a full complement of all types of batteries, portable USB charger/battery for phones, extra Apple/Android charger cables, small torch/lighter, rechargeable headlamps, LED lanterns, 12V USB plug-in-charger, bluetooth speaker, plus travel-sized packs of commonly forgotten stuff: toothbrushes, deoderants, dry shampoo, ibuprofen, antacids, etc etc.\n\nBedding - I have various bedding options from warm-weather light stuff through 0-degree comfy-cozy sleeping bags.\n\nFun Items -  ‘instant’ beach shelter, 2 camp chairs, 10”x12” ground mat/carpet, portable/instant propane fire pit, hammock & paracord, Mr Heater Buddy, multiple refills of green-bottle propane and butane, 10x10 pop-up shade/shelter.   \n\nSafety Item Kit - portable lithium jump starter, tire sealant, 12V tire inflator, fire extinguisher, tire pressure gauge (van has built in tire pressure monitors as well). \n\nKitchen items - all the basics like plates, utensils, glasses, pots/pans, etc and all the cooking stuff you could ever need like cooking spray, LOTS of spices & condiments & such, grill mats, etc etc.  If it’s there - you are welcome to use it to help make something tasty!\n\nAthletic Stuff: 12V air pump for air mattress or boats, yoga mats, hiking poles, extra backpacks, extra coats, paracords, squeezable water bottles, etc.\n\nAnything else to know?  Sure!  Read on, dear camper…\n(TLDR - too long; didn’t read - below simply states that the van has no cruise control, no shower/toilet setup, and may have imperfect details or fit & finish imperfections you won’t find on a brand-new Winnebago RV, as that is not its intent)\n\nThis van is built with a philosophy of convenience and simplicity - heavy on convenience and useful gear, and low on granite countertops.\n\nThis philosophy means that every feature/part of this van should simply *make sense* without explanation - no complicated plumbing and/or dump valves, no generators or confusing electrical work, no hidden water storage involving chemicals or long piping through questionably dirty hoses, etc.  \n\nThere are a few important choices made with this van:\n\nThe chassis is a base Transit - that means no cruise control (I don’t miss it, to be honest).  It does have bluetooth audio and a backup camera, however (must-haves!) \n\n-There is no integrated shower/toilet.  That all takes up too much space, and you don’t want to spend time trying to find & use a dump station at the end of your trip.  Shower-wise, you can move/place the electric \n-The bed is not power - you pull it forward, and then pull up slightly on the sides via the attached hidden handles to push it back into place....and you’ll need to be able to lift yourself up a bit or use something as a step to get up into bed, as the bed platform is pretty high to allow for more storage beneath.\n\nThat\'s it - enjoy & have fun!\n',2,16500,E'Sacramento',E'CA',E'95811',E'',E'US',E'Ford',E'Sacramento',2017,20,E'2019-05-06 00:06:06.545252+00',E'2020-06-30 17:23:07.957072+00',38.57,-121.49,E'https://res.cloudinary.com/outdoorsy/image/upload/v1562023338/p/rentals/119031/images/wchguimw6h3u9oonba9b.jpg',E'Steven Kayser',E'https://res.cloudinary.com/outdoorsy/image/upload/v1562025622/p/users/689664/images/adgfi2i1wszgrawmizwb.jpg'),
